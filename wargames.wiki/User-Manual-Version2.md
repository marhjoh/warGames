This should send you to the "Create Army" page. In order to create an army you will have to choose

If you reset the simulation from scratch you have to re-load the army files once more, and also select a terrain in order to simulate a new battle. If you reset the simulation with the same armies you do not have to do that, and can simulate right away!
