# Wargames

## Description
This product is a self-contained, independent tool that makes it possible for the end users to orchestrate and arrange a simulation of a battle between two armies in
a war in a seamless and easy way. Furthermore the program allows for automation of tasks known to have miscalculations when conducted manually.

## Installation
First download the program installer.

After you download the installer, please extract the .zip file to anywhere on your computer. \

Then you run the installer. You can not choose where on your computer the program will be installed. It will be placed in a new folder called WarGamesApplication in "C:\Program Files (x86)\WarGamesApplication". You can choose to make a shortcut on your desktop if you would like that. Please DO NOT move the application from the folder it was installed in, as it will not work.

Now you're done, and the program should be installed on your computer.
If you would like to uninstall the program at any time, there is an uninstaller in the same folder as the program was installed in, which should be "C:\Program Files (x86)\WarGamesApplication". To uninstall, simply open the file named unins000.

Note: Currently, saving and loading the application data doesn't work when you use the installer. If you would like this feature, you need to clone the GitLab repo in an IDE (e.g intelliJ).
